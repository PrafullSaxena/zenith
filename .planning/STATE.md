# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-20)

**Core value:** Reduce the friction of developer workflows through AI-augmented tooling — all in a single, fast, consistent desktop app.
**Current focus:** v3.0 — Task Groomer Plugin (planning phase)

## Current Position

Milestone: v3.0 — Task Groomer Plugin (IN PROGRESS)
Phase: 14-data-foundation — Plan 1 of N complete
Status: Executing Phase 14

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 10% (Phase 14 Plan 01 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 UI Revamp + v2.0 Launchpad Enhancement (combined — completed 2026-05-20):**
- Total phases: 13
- Total plans completed: 42
- ~62,400 LOC TypeScript
- Timeline: 2026-03-06 → 2026-05-20 (~75 days)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v2.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Key v3.0 decisions made during planning:**
- Task Groomer as standalone Zenith plugin (not global overlay) — consistent plugin pattern
- Tasks stored in tasks.db (SQLite, isolated from nebula.db/cortex.db)
- Jira: read for enrichment during grooming, push on explicit button click (not auto-sync)
- Re-groom per task available on demand (not batch-only)
- Task lifecycle: Dump → Groomed → Done / Delegated / Aborted (5 states)
- Stale indicator after 3 days in Dump status
- Clipboard auto-detection on popup open (URL, Jira ID, error text patterns)

**Phase 14 Plan 01 decisions (2026-05-19):**
- All 14 schema columns present from day one (grooming metadata nullable) — zero migrations needed until Phase 18
- No ORDER BY in listTasks SQL — renderer Zustand store handles sort order
- crypto.randomUUID() for UUID generation (built-in Node.js, no external dep)
- deleteTask is idempotent (success:true always); updateTask throws on missing id (fail-fast)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
